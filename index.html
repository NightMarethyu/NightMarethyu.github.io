    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Thank you for stopping by my portfolio. My name is Ammon Turner. I am a Computer Science student at Brigham Young Univeristy–Hawaii. My minors are Japanese and Economics. I have several years experience working in IT for a small 3D printing company in Utah. While there I worked with the company's sole software developer to maintain the website among other simple programming tasks. When he left I became the entire tech department for the company. It was working with him and doing the more CS related aspects of the job that inspired me to return to school to get a degree in CS.</p>
  <p>
    While at BYUH I've spent much of my time working with Java, Python, and C++. I have spent some time dabbling in other languages such as Rust and Go. I have a good amount of experience with web development (recall I maintained the website for that 3D printing company). I am often approached by my fellow students with questions about their code or related projects. I try to help them as much as I can and time allows.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of software development and I spend time reading, I'm a big speculative fiction fan (Sci-fi, fantasy, and the like). I have been told that I have a bit of a problem when it comes to table-top games. I have a decent collection of board and card games and enjoy a good TTRPG. I enjoy anime and manga, I have a decent grasp of the Japanese language and I love learning about different languages and cultures. I spent two years living in the Philippines as a missionary for the Chruch of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and can understand Tagalog (I spent most of my time there speaking Hiligaynon, a regional language of the Visayas).
